# A blog, with Gatsby, and Netlify CMS

I've been meaning to try out gatsby as boilerplate for a project, and a blog seems about right. I've been needing somewhere to put up my talks, and convert a few of them into blog posts. I think I'll be cross-posting to Medium, even if just with the [import tool](https://medium.com/p/import), I think. 

I chose the [gatsby-personal-starter-blog](https://github.com/thomaswangio/gatsby-personal-starter-blog) because I've really wanted to try out styling with `rebass` anyhow- it's made by the creator of `styled-system` and is apparently "the way he'd create a library using the styled-system". Nice. Also, people have banged on about how Netlify-CMS is easy to use and free, so, here goes nothing.

Time to see how this goes.
